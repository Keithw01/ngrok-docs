# ngrok Kubernetes Operator on Amazon EKS

:::tip TL;DR
To use the ngrok Kubernetes Operator with AWS EKS:

1. [Ensure `kubectl` can speak with your cluster](#prereqs)
1. [Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator](#install-the-ngrok-kubernetes-operator)
1. [Install a sample application](#install-a-sample-application)
1. [Add edge security to your app](#add-edge-security)

:::

## Introduction

The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator) is our official open-source controller for adding public and secure ingress traffic to your k8s services. It works out of the box with n AWS EKS Kubernetes cluster to provide ingress to your services no matter the network configuration, as long as it has outbound access to the ngrok service. This allows ngrok to be portable and work seamlessly across any type of infrastructure.

:::caution This tutorial requires:

1. An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup).
1. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
1. [Helm 3.0.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
1. An [AWS EKS cluster](https://eksctl.io/usage/creating-and-managing-clusters/)

:::

## **Step 1**: Ensure `kubectl` can speak with your cluster {#prereqs}

With an AWS EKS cluster, authentication for `kubectl` happens with a credential helper. So in-order to deploy the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to your cluster, you'll need to ensure that you can use the `aws` CLI and that the credential helper is available.

Recent versions of `eksctl` rely on the `aws eks get-token` command, which requires the `aws` CLI to be at-least version `1.16.156`.

Let's ensure that you have the `aws` CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials. You can confirm this works and you're authenticated correctly by running the following command:

```shell
aws --version
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If this works, we can now request a kubeconfig:

```shell
# This will merge the cluster into your $KUBECONFIG or ~/.kube/config
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region-code> --name <my-cluster>

# To keep your kubeconfig isolated, use:
aws eks update-kubeconfig --kubeconfig kubeconfig --region <region-code> --name <my-cluster>
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig
```

## **Step 2**: Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator {#install-the-ngrok-kubernetes-operator}

Now we can install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to provide ingress to our services.

Check out our [Operator installation doc](/docs/k8s/installation/install/) for
details on how to use Helm to install with your ngrok credentials.

## **Step 3**: Install a Sample Application {#install-a-sample-application}

Create a manifest file (for example `ngrok-manifest.yaml`) with the following contents. You will need to replace the `NGROK_DOMAIN` on line 45 with your own custom value. This is the URL you will use to access your service from anywhere. If you're on a free account, it must be on a static subdomain which you can claim by logging into your account and following the instructions on the claim static subdomain banner. For paid accounts, you can use a custom domain or a subdomain of `ngrok.app` or `ngrok.dev` (for example, `username-loves-ingress.ngrok.app` or `k8s.example.com`).

:::tip Notes:

- Lines 1-34: Create the 2048 app service and deployment
- Lines 35-54 (highlighted): Create the ngrok Kubernetes Operator. Line 45 determines the ingress URL for public requests.

# ngrok Ingress Controller Configuration
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: game-2048-ingress
  namespace: ngrok-ingress-controller
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: NGROK_DOMAIN
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: game-2048
                port:
                  number: 80
```

1. Apply the manifest file to your k8s cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ngrok-manifest.yaml
   ```

   **Note:** If you get an error when applying the manifest, double check that you've updated the `NGROK_DOMAIN` value and try again.

1. Access your ingress URL using the subdomain you chose in the manifest file above (i.e. `https://my-awesome-k8s-cluster.ngrok.app`) to confirm the 2048 app is accessible from the internet.

## Step 4: Add edge security to your app {#add-edge-security}

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator provides custom resource definitions (CRDs) for additional edge features available in ngrok. In this example, we're expanding the ngrok Kubernetes Operator with Google OAuth to allow access only from users with the email domains `@acme.com` or `@ngrok.com` and to apply a circuit breaker to your app at 80% (requires a paid account). These features are enforced at the ngrok edge, ensuring only authorized users can access your app.













As before, you will need to update line 46 of this manifest with your `NGROK_DOMAIN` in the Ingress object.

:::tip Notes:
This example is very similar to the previous version, with the following changes:

- Lines 41-42: Associates your Kubernetes Operator with the configuration `oauth-and-circuit-breaking` via annotation
- Lines 57-75: Sets the edge configuration as a custom CRD (NgrokModuleSet).
- Lines 64-69: Sets the circuit breaker module over 50% threshold.
- Lines 70-74: Sets the OAuth module to allow access only for users with the email domains `@acme.com` or `@ngrok.com`.

      http:
With our [Traffic Policy system](/docs/traffic-policy/) and the [`oauth`
action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth), ngrok manages OAuth protection
entirely at the cloud edge, which means you don't need to add any
additional services to your cluster, or alter routes, to ensure ngrok's edge
authenticates and authorizes all requests before allowing ingress and access to
your endpoint.

To enable the `oauth` action, you'll create a new `NgrokTrafficPolicy` custom
resource and apply it to your entire `Ingress` with an annotation. You can also
apply the policy to just a specific backend or as the default backend for an
`Ingress`â€”see our doc on using the [Operator with
Ingresses](/docs/k8s/guides/using-ingresses/#using-ngroktrafficpolicy-with-ingress).

1. Edit your existing `2048.yaml` manifest with the following, leaving the
   `Service` and `Deployment` as they were. Note the new `annotations` field and
   the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` CR.

   ```yaml
    ...

   # Configuration for ngrok's Kubernetes Operator
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: game-2048-ingress
     namespace: default
     annotations:
       k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: oauth
   spec:
     ingressClassName: ngrok
     rules:
       - host: <NGROK_DOMAIN>
         http:
           paths:
             - path: /
               pathType: Prefix
               backend:
                 service:
                   name: game-2048
                   port:
                     number: 80
   ---
   # Traffic Policy configuration for OAuth
   apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
   kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: oauth
     namespace: default
   spec:
     policy:
   	   on_http_request:
   		   - type: oauth
   			   config:
   			     provider: google
   ```

1. Re-apply your `2048.yaml` configuration.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f 2048.yaml
   ```

1. When you open your demo app again, you'll be asked to log in via Google.
   That's a start, but what if you want to authenticate only yourself or colleagues?

1. You can use [expressions](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/expressions) and [CEL
   interpolation](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to filter out
   and reject OAuth logins that don't contain `example.com`. Update the
   `NgrokTrafficPolicy` portion of your manifest after changing `example.com` to
   your domain.

   ```yaml
   ---
   # Traffic Policy configuration for OAuth
   apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
   kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: oauth
     namespace: default
   spec:
     policy:
   	   on_http_request:
   		   - type: oauth
   			   config:
   			     provider: google
   			 - expressions:
   			     - "!actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.email.endsWith('example.com')"
           actions:
             - type: custom-response
               config:
                 content: Hey, no auth for you ${actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.name}!
                 status_code: 400
   ```

1. Check out your deployed 2048 app once again. If you log in with an email that
   doesn't match your domain, ngrok rejects your request. Authentication... done!
